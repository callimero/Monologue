Some crazy experiment to recreate Jean-Michel Jarres Oxyg√®ne IV on a Korg Monologue (arranged on a DAW of course). 
Sounds should come only form monologue but can use effects in the DAW (like phasers, delay etc). I am not sure about "chordify" the monophonic voiced in DAW. Seems a bit cheating to me.

Sounds/patches could change (and some still suck I am for sure no musician and also new to synths), any hints or submitted patches are welcome!
