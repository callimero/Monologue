# Monologue
Patches and Stuff for Korg Monologue

Do what you want with it (MIT License, include it when you want to distribute). However a attribution is always welcome and tips and mutated sounds/patches are very welcome!

in /patches you find my patches as single .molgprog files. In /libraries I put collection libraries as .molglib if you like to check all.

For the patches I include a .wav and a image showing the parameters for the Monologue.
